        Todo:
        =====
            - Fix nav so the links and titles are actually correct!

            Low priority/another time:
            --------------------------
                - Seeing as week 08 won't work at all without JS, maybe use JS to generate the HTML based on the functions that are there? That could be a "feature".
                - Try Material icons if you want? <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet"> e.g.:
                    - <span class="material-icons-outlined">menu</span>
                    - <span class="material-icons-outlined">expand_more</span>

        Notes:
            - Don't have this massive comment too early on in the HTML! The encoding declaration needs to be within the first 1024 bites, sez FF dev tools :¬¨)

                        <p>Hi, I'm Joe üëãüèª (he/him, or they/them).</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I love making things ‚Äì mostly on computers ‚å®Ô∏è but not always ü™ö.</li>
                            <li>My working life has revolved around music üéπ and IT üñ•Ô∏è.</li>
                            <li>I've done some web development üîó before, but not for the last nine years<!-- üìÜüëÄ -->.</li>
                            <li>I was lucky to have some success in music, but the pandemic means I can't earn a living doing that now.</li>
                            <li>I always knew that music might not last forever, and have hoped for a while to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields">STE(A)M-y</a> career. Now's the time to make that happen.</li>
                            <li>I spend time away from screens when I can. üå≥</li>
                            <li>Some non-screen things I like doing are: walking <!-- üëü --> and cycling <!-- üö≤ --> around cities, hiking <!-- ü•æ --> outside of them, dancing <!-- üîä --> in small dark loud rooms, cooking<!-- üçù -->, and critter-spotting. üê∂üê±üê¶ü¶äüêÄ</li>

                        <p>Music connected me with new friends and introduced me to communities I might otherwise not have encountered. They were really important in helping me begin to see the world through their more diverse lenses: ones that were attuned to the experiences of marginalised groups.</p>
                        <p>The Internet played a big part in this. Individuals' voices could reach me that I probably wouldn't have heard without platforms like twitter or Instagram. I'm hugely grateful for the time and energy that so many people have spent sharing their thoughts, experiences, and resources. It's helped put me on a path of learning to live and act in more solidarity with those who are systemically oppressed.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>I enjoy solving problems, and making usually involves problem-solving!</li>
                                <li>I love to understand how things work, and making is a great way to deepen that understanding.</li>
                                <li>I like to be able to create or alter things to meet specific needs.</li>
                                <li>I get to learn, express myself creatively, discover a tool or process, and feel a sense of accomplishment.</li>
                                <li>I want to connect with other people: collaborators and audiences/users.</li>
                                <li>I want to have a positive impact on people and think building things is the best way I can do that.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3 id="why-2">2. Why does making things with code suit me?</h3>

                            <h4>I like computers!</h4>
                            <p>I've been fascinated with them since primary school. For a while, I mostly wanted to make "cool" stuff. And while that still matters, I'm now more interested in making stuff that's genuinely useful.</p>

                            <h4>It fits my skills</h4>
                            <p>I'm analytical and enjoy the challenge of solving logical problems. Studying mathematics and physics as a mature student really boosted my confidence in this area.</p>

                            <h4>It suits my values</h4>
                            <p>Compared to things like handcrafting a piece of furniture or growing vegetables, coding seems relatively accessible, fast, affordable, and portable.</p>
                            <p>The barriers to entry seem relatively low, meaning it's maybe a more inclusive path than other ways of building things. There's lots to learn, but you can see the results of your experiments very quickly, which is motivating.</p>

                            <h4>I want to make a positive contribution, and I think coding gives me the best chance of doing this</h4>
                            <p>Computers are everywhere, so code can be part of tackling problems in many different fields. Being a developer would provide me with the flexibility to work on a broad range of problems, social and otherwise.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3 id="why-3">3. Tech as a driver of social justice</h3>
                            <p>If you build websites, they can potentially reach a lot of people. Such broad reach means that what you make can have a social impact.</p>
                            <p>I believe that technology can truly help people. But I understand that it doesn't exist in a vacuum; it's not "apolitical".</p>
                            <p>For the web to do (at least!) <em>significantly more good than harm</em>, the people who build it should have the best understanding possible of the real-world, social contexts in which their technology lives.</p>
                            <p>I feel like my understanding is in its infancy, but I am glad to be on a journey of listening and learning. Building things in this mindset is how I hope I can be part of a more ethical, fair and humane world.</p>
                        </div>


                        <h2 id="why-fac">Why FAC?</h2>

                        <ul>

                            <li>I want my work to align with my values as much as possible, and I'm not sure that any other path into a career as a developer could facilitate this more than FAC.</li>
                            <li>It would be exciting to meet like-minded people and build things collaboratively.</li>
                            <li>I'm keen to learn things alongside peers in a mutually supportive environment. I enjoy helping others learn, and appreciate how this can enrich my own understanding.</li>

                        <h2>Week 09: Build a feature</h2>

                        <p>The design below represents a simple step sequencer, like you might find in a software drum machine, etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>It won't make any sound</strong> (see below for <a href="#footnote-1-text" id="footnote-1">why</a>), and is just intended as a simple UI demonstration and exploration.</p>
                        <p>There are some options for ways to interact with it, which are based on mouse input.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this is to let you work out what combination of mouse inputs feels most fluid and natural for you.</p>
                        <p>The default options selected below are what the author likes, but you might like something else! :)</p>
                        <p>You might find that some combinations of actions conflict with one another, or just feel very strange and unintuitive.</p>
                        <p>It won't work properly with a touchscreen device yet, as that's outside the scope of this feature for now.</p>
                        <p>Try clicking a step to toggle it on or off. Steps toggled on are considered "active", and off are considered "inactive".</p>
                        <!-- <p>Some of the controls present won't do anything, but it's important to have a bit of extra chrome thrown in so that the UI feels more like a real-world example.</p> -->

                        <p id="footnote-1-text">
                            I implemented some basic noise-making functionality, based on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Advanced_techniques">these</a> <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/">examples</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I mostly understood the concepts and most of the code I was writing, I don't think that I've properly understood an example unless I can change it/rewrite it/write it from scratch to do "whatever I want".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this case, with the time constraints I gave myself, I couldn't do that. So I didn't think it was fair to call the noise-making code "code I've written", as per the FAC spec for the application website.
