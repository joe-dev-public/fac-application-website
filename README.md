# Founders and Coders application website

## What is this?

A small website built as part of an application to the Founders and Coders Jan 2022 cohort.

The following pages (as accessed during November and December 2021) were used to guide the spec/scope/content for the site:

- https://www.foundersandcoders.com/requirements/website
- https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/application/building-a-site/
- https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/application/objects/
- https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/application/feature/
- https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/application/debugging/


## Is the website currently published anywhere?

Yes, it's viewable on [GitHub Pages](https://joe-dev-public.github.io/fac-application-website/).


## How was it tested?

Mostly in Firefox and a bit in Chrome on Windows 10. Also a bit in Chrome and Firefox on Android 12.


## Is it completely finished?

That depends!

As of first creating this README, the code for the site hasn't been modified since it was committed for the application deadline.

It could do with cleaning up. Various bits weren't finished or polished properly. Comments in the code contain some (incomplete!) todos.
